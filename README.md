# 💳 Payment Gateway - Observability Enabled

This is a simulated **Payment Gateway system** built with **FastAPI** (backend) and **React.js** (frontend), fully instrumented with **OpenTelemetry** to capture **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**, and visualized using **Grafana**. The observability data is collected using **Grafana Alloy**, and exported to **Prometheus**, **Loki**, and **Tempo**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:
- Demonstrate end-to-end observability using open-source tools.
- Gain hands-on experience with telemetry instrumentation and visualization.
- Build a full-stack project with real-time operational insights.

---

## 🌟 Impact

- ✅ Helps in identifying performance issues and bottlenecks.
- ✅ Detects and traces errors with high granularity.
- ✅ Real-time monitoring and alerting using Prometheus and Grafana.
- ✅ Industry-grade observability practice using open standards.

## 📖 What is Observability?

Observability is the ability to measure the internal state of a system by examining its outputs. It helps developers and operators understand what’s happening inside their systems.

### 🔍 3 Pillars of Observability
1. **Metrics** – Quantitative measurements (e.g., request count, CPU usage).
2. **Logs** – Textual data describing discrete events (e.g., errors, requests).
3. **Traces** – Detailed journey of a request through services (e.g., spans with latency).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Payment-Gateway-Obs.git
cd Payment-Gateway-Obs
````

### 2. Create Logs Folder

```bash
mkdir -p server/routers/logs
```

### 3. Run the Full Stack

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### 4. Access the Services

* 🌐 Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
* 🔧 FastAPI Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
* 📊 Grafana: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* 📈 Prometheus: [http://localhost:9091](http://localhost:9091)
* 🔍 Tempo: [http://localhost:3200](http://localhost:3200)
* 📜 Loki: [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100)

## ⚙️ Features

### ✅ API Endpoints

* `POST /payment` – Accepts a payment and stores it.
* `GET /transactions` – Fetches all transactions.
* `POST /admin` – Simulates an error (for testing logs/traces).
* `GET /admin/health` – Health check for API and DB.

### 📦 Observability

* **Metrics**: Request count, error rates, etc. (via Prometheus)
* **Logs**: Structured logs using OTEL and Python logging
* **Traces**: Request lifecycle tracking with spans

---

## 📊 Grafana Dashboards

Visualize:

* API call latencies
* Errors and logs in context
* Traces across services

---

## 🔔 Alerts in Grafana

Create alert rules like:

* ❗ High number of errors in `/admin`
* 🐌 Slow responses (e.g. >1s latency)
* 📉 Drop in transaction volume

---

## 🔮 Improvements & Resume Enhancements

* [ ] 🔐 Add authentication (JWT/OAuth2)
* [ ] 📦 Integrate OpenSearch for advanced log analytics
* [ ] 🤖 Add AI/ML anomaly detection (e.g., with PyCaret or Prophet)
* [ ] 🧪 Add unit tests + CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
* [ ] 📥 Add API rate limiting or retry logic
* [ ] 💬 Setup Slack/Email alerting for system failures
